## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Texas A&M University. My research focuses on understanding cognitive functions across young and older adulthood, especially brain mechanisms and risk factors that lead to differential cognitive trajectories in aging (healthy vs. pathological/Alzheimer's disease). Moreover, I study how lifestyle interventions may promote cognitive function across the lifespan. In my research, I use a variety of techniques, including cognitive assessments, experience sampling, multimodal neuroimaging (functional, structural, diffusion MRI), computational neuroscience methods, and blood-based biomarkers. Currently, I lead the Lifespan Health Neuroscience Lab at Texas A&M University.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, eating great food and desserts, and photography.
